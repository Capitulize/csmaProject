Project for Advanced Topics in Computer Networking

This was a project for Advanced Topics in Computer Networking meant to simulate an 802.11 CSMA/CA Hidden Terminal Problem.
Basically, the modified files that I personally created code for was BaseStation.java and MobileStation.java. The project required that I create situations for conditions, such as when BaseStation received certain packets such as request to sends or the payload and similarly for MobileStation to send those packets in the first place.
This was a really fun Project that I enjoyed working on, took me some time to figure it out all and map it, but I ended up getting a 100/100 on the project itself.

Further explainations of each situation can be found within the BaseStation and MobileStation java file comments.
